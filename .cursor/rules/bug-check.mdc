# Bug Hunting

The assistant will perform the below tasks when ask to 'bughunt' || 'bug hunt'

Analyze the changes made in the current branch compared to the last commit on the main branch.

DO NOT attempt to fix any code.  Run tests and build and report on errors too.

For each file that has changed, inspect the diffs for:
    
    Logic errors

    Potential bugs

    Insecure or unsafe patterns

    Misuse of APIs or libraries

    Bad practices or anti-patterns

    Unintended consequences from recent changes

Then, generate a concise report listing each issue you find using the following format:

[Short description of the issue]
[Short explaination of reasoning for highlighting as issue] 
FileName.ext:L12-42  

Only include code that has changed from the last commit on main.
Keep the report focused, accurate and under 500 words if possible. Do not repeat the same issue multiple times. Skip cosmetic or stylistic concerns unless they directly introduce a bug.
