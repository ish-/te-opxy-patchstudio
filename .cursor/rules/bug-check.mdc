# Bug Hunting

## Bug Hunt

Analyze the changes made in the current branch compared to the last commit on the main branch.

DO NOT attempt to fix any code.  Run tests and build and report on errors too.

For each file that has changed, inspect the diffs for items int eh bug checklist

Only include code that has changed from the last commit on main.

## Detailed Bug Hunt

The assistant will perform the below tasks when ask to 'detailedbughunt' || 'detailed bug hunt'

DO NOT attempt to fix any code.  Run tests and build and report on errors too.

Inspect the code for items in the bug checklist

Then, generate a concise report listing each issue you find using the following format:

[Short description of the issue]
[Short explaination of reasoning for highlighting as issue] 
FileName.ext:L12-42  

Start with the most important functions in the program and work outward.  We can run the report multiple times.

## Report format

Then, generate a concise report listing each issue you find using the following format. Make sure to only return text.

```
fix this bug
[Short description of the issue]
[Short explaination of reasoning for highlighting as issue]

Keep the report focused, accurate and under 500 words if possible. Do not repeat the same issue multiple times. Skip cosmetic or stylistic concerns unless they directly introduce a bug.
